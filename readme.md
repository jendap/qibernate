Qibernate Demo
==============

Do not use this! It's a pile of crap. It just shows multiple technologies. But it's not a good demo project as it show
how to do one thing multiple ways in one project. You'd better not be writing DAO five different ways within single
project ;-)

Fell free to ask how to use it or what can you learn here!
